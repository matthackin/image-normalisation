# image-normalisation

Simple Java code I wrote to prove what we learnt in COMPSCI 373 (Computer Graphics and Image Processing) works. This will `normalise` an image specified in [Main.java](Main.java) and output a copy of this normalised version.

I have also implemented this on my website as `JavaScript`, see [Image Normalisation](https://matthack.in/contrast-stretching-image-normalisation).
